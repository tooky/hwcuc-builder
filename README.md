#The Cucumber Book - Code

This repository contains the code for the cucumber book.

Each chapter has it's own branch - and each incremental step in that chapter is
marked with a new branch. The chapter branches are orphan's - they are not related to
this master branch.

## TODO

* Script to push changes up through the branches (`git-filter-branch` ?) 
* Script to generate code directory for the book
